## @Spilopelia-C (Andy)

Interested in **Epidemiology & Biomedical Engineering**, though my projects focus primarily on epidemiology due to skill issues. Feel free to poke around my code and open issues or pull requests. <br>
  -  Currently learning Machine Learning on Data Analysis. <br>
  -  Works with Python (and Ti-BASIC), currently learning Java for APCSA. <br>

Collaboration on a project? Simply leave a message. <br>
Collaboration on in-school stuff? idk, see me in person
